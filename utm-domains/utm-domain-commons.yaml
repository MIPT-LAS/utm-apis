    This file contains the core UTM models as OpenAPI 2.0 compliant definitions.

    Some key caveats when using/referencing this API:
      1. The API on its own is insufficeint to develop a USS or other UTM
      component.  For example, the USS Specification is needed to understand
      how and when to use the various endpoints and provides more details on
      security features that cannot be captured in the API docs.
      2. There is not a unified time synchronization approach in UTM currently.
      As such, times provided from one server MUST NOT be validated against
      each other.  For example, if a sending server states that a data element
      was sent at 10:00:23, but the receiving server thinks it is currently
      10:00:22, the receiving server MUST NOT reject the data submission.  As
      we develop and roll out the time synchronization scheme for the USS
      Network, we will add appropriate validation requirements to the API
      documentation.
      3. On the contrary, times MUST be validated for consistency within a
      given data submission.  For example, if a server states that it sends
      a data instance at 10:00:23 and one of the other data elements states
      that a measurement was performed at 10:00:24, then the receiving server
      MUST reject that data submission. Some of these checks are explictly
      stated in the descriptions below. If you recognize any such checks that
      are not documented, please submit an issue report on github.

  data_accessibility:
    description: >-
      Each data member of each model will be tagged with a value representing
      its accessibility level.  This enum provides the potential values.

      Each value of the enum implies AT LEAST the accessibility of the previous
      value.  With the ordering:

        PUBLIC <= OPERATIONAL <= SAFETY <= SPECIAL

      The most restrictive value possible will be chosen for each data member
      while still meeting overall objectives of the system. Finding the correct
      values will likely be an on-going process. The values will be a first
      cut in the research platform version of UTM.

      The server receiving a request for data will need to filter the results
      based on the authorization presented by the requesting server.  Further
      details to be developed later.

  severity:
    description: >-
      The severity level of a UTMMessage. This severity labeling may be used by
      other components within UTM as well.  The labels are ordered such that
      they may be given priority handling by software systems and human users.
      **EMERGENCY > ALERT > CRITICAL > WARNING > NOTICE > INFORMATIONAL**
      In relation to a UTMMessage, the severities may be interpreted as follows.
      1. **EMERGENCY**
        There is an *immediate* impact to the safety of other air operations, the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      2. **ALERT**
        There may be an impact to the safety of other air operations, the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      3. **CRITICAL**
        Without mitigations by the affected operation, the situation may rise to an emergency in the near future.
      4. **WARNING**
        There is a contained issue that may result in the loss of aircraft. No immediate or likely effect to other operations, people on the ground, or structures.
      5. **NOTICE**
        This issue is provided for situational awareness. Planning by operators and USSs may be affected.
      6. **INFORMATIONAL**
          This issue is provided for situational awareness. Note that this approach leverages RFC 5424: "The Syslog Protocol." By taking this approach, there is the possibility of formalizing UTMMessaging with more elements of the RFC to allow for compatibility with other logging systems. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424

          The current state of the operation.  Must be maintained by the USS.
          Some additional details in the USS Specification.
          1. ACCEPTED
            This operation has been deemed ACCEPTED by the supporting USS. This implies that the operation meets the requirements for operating in the airspace based on the type of operation submitted.
          2. ACTIVATED
            This operation is active. The transition from ACCEPTED to ACTIVATED is not an announced transition. The transition is implied based on the submitted start time of the operation (i.e. the effective_time_begin of the first OperationVolume). Note that an ACTIVATED operation is not necessarily airborne, but is assumed to be "using" the OperationVolumes that it has announced.
          3. CLOSED
            This operation is closed. It is not airborne and will not become airborne again. If the UAS and the crew will fly again, it would need to be as a new operation. A USS may announce the closure of any operation, but is not required to announce unless the operation was ROGUE or NONCONFORMING.
          4. NONCONFORMING
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.
          5. ROGUE
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.

          A note on "intersection":
            Note 2: All of the terms "crosses", "within", "touches" imply
            intersection. I can track down a source for this definition
            (probably OGC), but for now, you can see it illustrated in the
            description for PostGIS intersection:
              https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html

          Validation of the array must include the following checks:
            1. The array of operation volumes must have minimum length of 1.
            2. The array of operation volumes must have maximum length of 250.
            3.  Each operation volume must have non-zero 4D volume (i.e. each of
             the 4 dimensions much be > 0 in magnitude).
            4. Volume intersection must pass the following checks:
              a. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have a 2D or 3D spatial intersection with its immediately
              preceding operation volume.
              b. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have a non-negative temporal intersection with its
              immediately preceding operation volume (Note we'd calculate this
              by t1-t2 where t1 is the preceding operation volume end time and
              t2 is the succeeding operation volume start time.).
              c. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have either a non-zero volume (3D) intersection OR a positive
              temporal intersection. (Note it may have both intersection types.)
            5. Each spatial dimension of an op vol's bounding box must have
            length less than M. Should discuss with partners the value of M.
            This is a sanity check against excessively large volumes. Need to
            be careful here as there may be legitimate use cases wherein large
            volumes are required/allowed, but we want to encourage efficient
            planning and protect against misuse of the shared airspace.
            6. The planned duration of an op vol must be less than T. Again,
            need to be careful to not damage legitimate use cases, but need to
            protect against misuse/poor planning. For long duration missions,
            it may be reasonable to have them replan or to have volumes with
            the same geog and long time values that slightly intersect.

            1. LOST_C2_UPLINK
              The operation has lost command or control uplink to the vehicle.
            2. LOST_C2_DOWNLINK
              The operation has lost downlinks from the vehicle.
            3. LOST_NAV
              The vehicle no longer has sufficient navigation sources.
            4. LOST_SAA
              The vehicle's sense and avoid solution is no longer reliable.
            5. LOW_FUEL
              The vehicle does not have enough power to complete its mission. Still enough fuel to safely land or potentially return to base.
            6. NO_FUEL
              The vehicle is either completely without fuel or has only enough fuel to land immediately.
            7. MECHANICAL_PROBLEM
              The vehicle is experiencing a mechanical problem necessitating initiation of a contingency response.
            8. SOFTWARE_PROBLEM
              The vehicle or some component of the required platform ground equipment is experiencing a software problem.
            9. ENVIRONMENTAL
              There are conditions in the environment necessitating initiation of a contingency response. Generally these will be weather-related phenomena.
            10. SECURITY
              There is a security incident interrupting this operation.
            11. TRAFFIC
              The density or type of air traffic near the vehicle necessitated a contingency response.
            12. LOST_USS
              The operation has lost at least some portion of expected USS services.
            13. OTHER
              Some cause not captured in any other category.
            14. ANY

          field is required for all message_types except OTHER_SEE_FREE_TEXT.
          1. UNPLANNED_LANDING
            This operation had to land earlier than expected and/or at a location other than was originally planned. Must be sent with severity CRITICAL unless there is any damage other than to the UAS.
          2. UNCONTROLLED_LANDING
            This operation had an uncontrolled landing either at the originally planned landing location or another location. Must be sent with severity CRITICAL unless there is any damage other than to the UAS.
          3. OPERATION_NONCONFORMING
            This operation has entered the NONCONFORMING state. Must be sent to LUN anytime operation transitions to this state. Must be sent with severity ALERT if the operation is expected to intersect another operation plan or unauthorized airspace.  Must be sent with severity EMERGENCY if already intersecting another operation or if already entered unauthorized airspace. Otherwise, must be sent with severity CRITICAL.
          4. OPERATION_ROGUE
            This operation has entered the ROGUE state. Must be sent to LUN anytime operation transitions to ROGUE state. Must be sent with severity ALERT if no current or immediate intersection with another operation or unauthorized airspace. Must be sent with severity EMERGENCY is known to intersect with existing operation or unauthorized airspace.
          5. OPERATION_CONFORMING
            This operation was previously in the NONCONFORMING state and has transitioned back to the ACTIVE state. 'gufi' field is required with this message_type.
          6. OPERATION_CLOSED
            This operation has entered the terminal CLOSED state. The operation will not again be active or in flight. This message is not required if the operation is transitioned to the CLOSED state from the ACTIVE state, but may be provided at the USS's discretion. This message is required when the operation transitioned from any state other than the ACTIVE state to the CLOSED state. If transitioning an operation from ACCEPTED to CLOSED, this message must have a severity of NOTICE. If transitioning from NONCONFORMING or ROGUE, this message must have a severity of CRITICAL.
          7. CONTINGENCY_PLAN_INITIATED
            Description TBD.
          8. CONTINGENCY_PLAN_CANCELLED
            Description TBD.
          9. PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_START
            The requestor wants position reports provided for the operation referenced in the 'gufi' field of this request. Reports MUST be provided as per the USS Specification. Must be sent with severity NOTICE.
          10. PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_END
            The requestor wants previously requested position reports to end. If this message is received without a corresponding PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_START, the message response is TBD (200, 400, 401, 404, etc.). Must be sent with severity NOTICE.
          11. UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_PROXIMITY
            An operation is within 3038 feet (almost 0.5nmi) from the boundary of unauthorized airspace (e.g., Dynamic Restriction/TFR, controlled airspace, airspace constraint)
          12. UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_ENTRY
            An operation has breached the boundary and entered into unauthorized airspace (e.g., Dynamic Restriction/TFR, controlled airspace, airspace constraint)
          13. OTHER_SEE_FREE_TEXT
            Messages that do not fit any of the otherwise defined categories. Should be used sparingly or with additional out-of-band description.

          A base URL used by the USS Discovery Service and other USS Instances
          to callback to the USS Instance.
          USS Discovery will append "/uss" to the base URL in order to POST a
          new uss_instance to the USS Instance. It will also do the same to test
          the URL when it first receives a uss_instance.
          USS Instances and other clients/services will append "/operations" to
          the base URL in order to share operations. Similarly with
          "/utm_messages", "/negotiations", etc.
          The base URL will also be used in obtaining the websocket for position
          sharing.
          This URL may be unique to the USS Instance or may be shared by other
          USS Instances created by the same USS.  URLs that are common to
          multiple USS Instances will receive only one callback.
